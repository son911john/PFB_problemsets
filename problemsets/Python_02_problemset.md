Python 2 Problem Set -- Operators, Truth, Logic
===================

1. Use the Interactive Interpretor to test to see if you can find an ['ATG' in](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018#membership-operators) the following DNA string:

```
GTACCTTGATTTCGTATTCTGAGAGGCTGCTGCTTAGCGGTAGCCCCTTGGTTTCCGTGGCAACGGAAAA
```

2. How about 'TTT'?

3. Save the DNA string to a variable and do [1 and 2](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018#membership-operators) again.

4. In the interpretor use `bool` to test a variety of values like '', 0, 0.0, FALSE, false, True, true, 'True', 'False' to see if they evalue to True or False.

5. Using a text editor, write a script that 
    - Assigns a value to a variable
    - Has a [if/else statment](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018#logic-control-statements) in which:
       - It prints out a confirmation of truth if the value is true
       - It prints out "Not True" if the value is not true. 

6. Make sure to commit your changes along the way. You can wait until the end to push them to your remote repo, if you like, or you can do it now. 

7. Write a new script that does the same as the question #5, but gets the value you will store in the variable from the command line. [Remember `sys` in the notes](pfb2018#command-line-parameters-a-special-built-in-list). 

8. Create a script that has a [if/else statement](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018#if-statement) that (remember to write a little bit at a time and test it)
    - Test to see if a number is positive or negative
    - print "positive" if it is positive
    - print "negative" if it is negative
    - save it and run it.
9. Add an [elif](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018#ifelif) to test if the number is equal to 0. Save it and run it.

10. Add nested tests to your last script
    - if it is positive, in addition to printing "positive"
    - test if it is smaller than 50
    - save it and run it    
            
11. Add more nested tests to your script.
    - if it is smaller than 50
    - test if the number is even
    - if it is smaller than 50 and even, print "it is an even number that is smaller than 50"
    - save it and run it
         
12. Add more nested tests.  
    -  if it is larger than 50,  
    -  test if the number is divisible by 3  
    -  if the number is larger than 50 and divisible by 3, print "it is larger than 50 and divisible by 3"  
    -  save it and run it
